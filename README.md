# Game Chaos
This is a Python script that generates the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle with random die rolls. The project was inspired by the Numberphile video below (check out their channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A)).

The code in `triangle.py` will produce an image that looks something like this:
