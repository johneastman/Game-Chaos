# Game Chaos

This project is based on a video I found on the Numberphile YouTube channel. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) is that video.

This algorithm will produce an image that will look something like [this](https://github.com/johneastman/Game-Chaos/blob/master/images/trianglular_fractal.PNG).
